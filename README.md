Abstract of The Project
We came up with this project so it will help people choose the travel op?on which is the best suited for
their interest. The parameters we are looking at are the cost of the travel schedule plan and the ?me of
the travel schedule plan. We are crea?ng travel schedule plan which creates the shortest path from
ini?al loca?on then goes through all planned des?na?ons. For example, if customer wants to travel to
Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Jose, and Las Vegas, then we would provide the shortest path from the
ini?al loca?on which goes through all desired travel des?na?ons, but never go through the same travel
des?na?ons again. Also, we are providing the cost of the travel and the ?me of the travel if the customer
wants different travel op?ons such as driving by car, using long distance bus, or ride on airplane.
For data structures and algorithms, we are using graphs, traversals, and shortest paths.
